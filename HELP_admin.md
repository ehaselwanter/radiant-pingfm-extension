You can have updates to your site automatically send details to your 
Ping.fm account. All you'll need to do is provide your account information
in the Radiant::Config settings.

The required keys are `pingfm.api_key`, `pingfm.application_api_key` and `pingfm.url_host`.

You can get the keys at

* API Key - http://ping.fm/key/
* Application API Key - http://ping.fm/developers/

On the edit screen of each page, you can select the option to notify Ping.fm
of all of the updates to the children of that page. You can create a blog page,
for example, and have each new post linked in your Ping.fm account.

_Built with version `1.0.2` of the `pingfm` gem._
